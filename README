Nuclei Segmentation 
written by Dara Rouholiman
--------------------------
The networks can be trained to perform nuclei segmentation on pathological images of various sizes. 
There are three different models presented: 
U-net 
CNN 
RCNN 
Checkout the included Jupyter notebooks that is ready to be tested on Google Colab environment. The pathological images can be acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data or clone from https://github.com/darar1/datasciencebowl2018.git
